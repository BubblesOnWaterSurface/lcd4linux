 * Revision 1.1  2004/01/09 17:03:07  reinelt
 * initiated transfer to new driver architecture
 * new file 'drv.c' will someday replace 'display.c'
 * new file 'drv_MatrixOrbital.c' will replace 'MatrixOrbital.c'
 * due to this 'soft' transfer lcd4linux should stay usable during the switch
 * (at least I hope so)
